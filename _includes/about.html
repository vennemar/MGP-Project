                                        If paper enabled the sharing of knowledge, the printing press made it popular. With a cheap way to mass produce books, and other text, the literacy of the world’s civilizations rose dramatically. The rise in the number of people able to participate in the sharing of knowledge led to a corresponding increase in the rate of innovation, and the level of general education.

                                        The steam engine truly started the industrial revolution. The trains it fueled provided a transportation infrastructure on a level impossible before. The machinery it powered enabled the most labor intensive, manual tasks to be done faster and more consistently. The cost of goods dropped, and the average person could afford things they previously wouldn’t have been able to.

Not only that, they changed the way we communicate with each other. The pace of communication, and the integration of technology and communication with daily life has increased dramatically. It’s hard to imagine modern life without these things, and there are many people who would find it difficult to function in their daily life without the use of a phone or laptop.
